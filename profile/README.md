# 👋 Welcome to Sitiofy

### 🇵🇭 Empowering Communities with Technology

**Sitiofy** is a GitHub organization focused on developing digital solutions that support local governance and community services in the Philippines. Our primary initiative is the **Barangay Management System** — a platform designed to improve how barangays operate and deliver services to their constituents.

---

## 🚀 What We Do

We build software that helps barangays:
- Manage resident and household data efficiently
- Track services, requests, blotters, and clearances
- Automate the generation of official documents and reports
- Improve transparency and streamline internal workflows

Our mission is to **digitize and modernize barangay operations**, empowering local leaders to provide better, faster, and more accountable services to their communities.
